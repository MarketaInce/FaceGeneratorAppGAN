# *Face Generator* - Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network

This project is a part of [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

*Submitted: Aug 2019*

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a neural network that is capable of generating **new** images of human faces.

### Methods Used
* Generative Adversarial Network (**GAN**)
* Convolutional Neural Network (**CNN**)

### Technologies
* Python
* PyTorch

### Training Data
The data used to train this GAN is [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html). This dataset contains over **200K** images of celebrities with different attributes. As discussed in the submitted project this dataset has a certain disadvantage, which is the lack of diversity (skin color, age, gender, ...), nevertheless it is a great free resource for deep learning applications.

## Project Description
As mentioned above the objective of this project is to create and train a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network that can generate **new** images of human faces. **New** face means that these images don't belong to actual people, but instead are created by the network by transforming and image of random noise.

The GAN is composed of two different networks (see example architecture below) serving two different purposes. On one side there is so called *Generator*, in this case it is a CNN passing image of random noise through it's layers trying to generate image of human face at it's end. On the other side is so called *Discriminator*, which is a CNN classifier trying to recognize real images from images generated by the *Generator*.

Both *Generator* and *Discriminator* are trained at the same time and optimized each using Binary Cross Entropy Loss.
